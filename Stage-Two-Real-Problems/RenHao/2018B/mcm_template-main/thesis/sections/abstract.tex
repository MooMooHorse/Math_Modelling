  Little introduction on background.\\
  For the first part of the program, our subject is countries since one country has same feature for choosing languages and
  we only consider the choice of first language and second language for the new-borns, 
  since other subjects have less possiblity of changing their choice of first and second language.
  For the first language, we set a model with the assumption that the new-born take the native language of the country as their first language.
  For the second language, we set choose-second-language model, changing perdiction model to assessment model for individual, and we use 
  Monte Carlo Method to change the number of second language speaker to certain languages,
  and we assign different weight by AHP model to different factors that might affect the choices made by
  people in different countries. 
  For the second part of the problem, we target at languages and select them by multiple matrices, merging them if possible and locate 6 extra office
  that can provide most target customoers convenience still with AHP model.
